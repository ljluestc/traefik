# Custom Error Pages for Traefik-Generated Errors

## Description

This PR implements a solution for [issue #2936](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/2936), which requests a feature to differentiate between Traefik-generated errors (like 502 when no backends are available) and upstream backend errors.

The implementation adds a new `traefikErrors` middleware that specifically targets errors generated by Traefik itself, allowing users to configure custom error pages for these errors without affecting the error responses returned by their backend services.

## Features

- New `traefikErrors` middleware that only handles errors generated by Traefik
- Intelligent detection of error sources (Traefik vs. backend)
- Compatible with the existing `errors` middleware
- Global configuration that works even when no matching route is found
- Comprehensive documentation with examples

## Use Case

This feature is particularly useful for users who want to:

1. Display custom, user-friendly error pages when Traefik itself generates errors (e.g., "No backend available")
2. Allow their backend applications to handle their own error responses without interference

## Example Configuration
